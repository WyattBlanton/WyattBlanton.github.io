      <div class="why-text">
        <p>I love driving and I love cars. I have since I was a kid. I grew up around them and honestly with them. There are very few parts of my life that the automotive industry hasn’t had an impact on. Because of this, I am very passionate about road safety. My father owns a towing and collision repair business, and I ran a tow truck for several years. I’ve seen all kinds of accidents for all kinds of different reasons. I know that most people don’t really think about it until they have a close call or a friend gets in an accident, but it happens all the time. According to NHTSA, there were 40,901 traffic fatalities in 2023. That’s over double the number of gun deaths in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive. It’s over 5,000 more than gun injuries, according to the same source. Driving is inherently dangerous. Yet, every day, most of the nation wakes up and does it without a thought. My hope with this interview isn’t to scare people or call them out on their behavior, but instead to simply inspire them to take just a little bit of interest in their driving. I know that sounds like it wouldn’t accomplish anything, but according to Forbes, 37% of people admitted to texting and driving or driving distracted. Around 12% of fatal car accidents involved a distracted driver. If these stories from Kyle made half those people think twice about picking up their phone, it would save over 2,000 lives. Through my personal experience, I believe that number would be even higher. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve towed a car away from a collision and found a phone laying in the floor board. It only takes a moment of inattentiveness to make a mistake that could cost a life. I just hope that anyone who watches this documentary and reads this post will think twice before texting and driving.</p>
        <p class="emphasized">This film is a personal exploration of that passion and a call for greater awareness on the road.</p>

    <h2>What is "Man in Motion"?</h2>
    <div class="story-item left-bubble">
      <h3>The One That Got Away (Crashed)</h3>
      <p>This is Kyle’s introduction, where he jokes about looking around the junkyard we were in, and seeing if there was anything there that he crashed. That’s when he spotted what was supposed to be his first tow truck. The whole shop spent about a month prepping, servicing, and painting it. It had all new lights, a fresh interior, new speakers, and just about anything else that would make it comfortable for a 12-hour shift. Before Kyle ever even got to drive it down the road, another employee fell asleep at the wheel to put it into a guardrail. Totaling the truck.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item right-bubble">
      <h3>Honing the Craft (and Bending the Law?)</h3>
      <p>After that remission, Kyle talks about how his driving skills were crafted and honed through his work with us. He focuses in on one of his most memorable driving stories. That being when he towed a burnt dump truck from Wilmington back to Dunn. The bed was full of wet clay, and it was extremely heavy, so he towed it with all the wheels on the ground and every chain he had in the truck attached to it. He remembers passing a state trooper who just looked at him and shook his head. Needless to say, it didn’t look super safe.
      </p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item left-bubble">
      <h3>The Junkyard Meet-Cute (of Towing)</h3>
      <p>Then he talked about when he first met me and my family in the very junkyard we were sitting in. We were moving some cars around with a backhoe and there was nowhere to stand, so he was told to climb on top of the backhoe. Now, what do you do when standing on top of a backhoe that’s moving cars? Well, you talk, obviously. And if you yap as much as Kyle, you secure yourself a job for the next 5 years. That was the day his adventure in the automotive world really started. </p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item right-bubble">
      <h3>Chain Reaction (and Broken Drivelines)</h3>
      <p>He then moved on to speak of the first job he did for Carl, his new employer. He was told to go pull out a convertible mustang with a 2004 Ford F250. He said Carl’s exact words were “don’t come back till it’s out”. So, he went and did just that. He explains that the car was quite stuck and that where it was wasn’t a place that the truck alone could have gotten out of easily. He also tells us that all he had was a chain, not exactly the exact right kind of kit for the situation at hand. Chains don’t fair too well when they are jerked on repeatedly with several thousands of pounds of force. But, he was asked to do a job. He jerked on the car over and over again. Trying to get so much run up that he backed into it. When he finally got it out and drove off, he realized he had broken something in the driveline of the truck. But “don’t come back till it’s out” was what he was told. 
      </p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item left-bubble">
      <h3>A Legacy of Breakage</h3>
      <p>His destructive streak didn’t end there though, in fact it followed him throughout his entire employment and past. We both reminisced about everything he had broken through the years and even pointed out some that were in the very junkyard we sat in. One after another, he listed them. Some old and some very recent. But sometimes that’s just what it takes to get the job done, or to have some fun. </p>
