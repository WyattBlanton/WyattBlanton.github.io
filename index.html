      <div class="why-text">
        <p>I love driving. Honestly, I love just about anything that'll go fast, and because of this love, I have spent most of my life driving in some way or another. So have my friends. I couldn't very well interview myself, so I interviewed Kyle. He's been a friend of mine for going on 10 years now. But even bigger than our shared passion for driving, we think it's important to have a basic amount of road wariness. Ignorance is bliss unless you're in the drivers seat. It's my hope that anyone who watches this documentary is inspired by the stories or the visuals and develops at least a mild fascination with their driving and the driving of others. As tow truck drivers, we've seen what happens when people ignore it.</p>
        <p class="emphasized">This film is a personal exploration of that passion and a call for greater awareness on the road.</p>

    <h2>What is "Man in Motion"?</h2>
    <div class="story-item left-bubble">
      <h3>The One That Got Away (Crashed)</h3>
      <p>His intro where he talks about looking around our junkyard and laughing about seeing if there was anything he crashed. He ends up talking about a tow truck he was meant to drive that someone else ended up driving and crashing it into a guard rail.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item right-bubble">
      <h3>Honing the Craft (and Bending the Law?)</h3>
      <p>Then he talks about learning how to drive and honing that skill. He talks about towing a burnt dump truck filled with wet clay on a zaclift on the back of a tractor trailer. Then we touch on how illegal it looked. How a state trooper saw him made eye contact then just shook his head and ignored him.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item left-bubble">
      <h3>The Junkyard Meet-Cute (of Towing)</h3>
      <p>Then he talked about when he first met me and my family in the very junkyard we were sitting in. We were pulling out a stuck convertible mustang with a 2004 6.0 powerstroke ford. Carl, my father, had said "go pull it out and don't come back till its out."</p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item right-bubble">
      <h3>Chain Reaction (and Broken Drivelines)</h3>
      <p>Then he talked bout pulling it out with a chain which wasn't really meant ot be snatched on. Then he had to do boosted launches after one another. He backed up so far to get a start that he actually backed into the car and kept jerking it out.</p>
      <p>Then when he went to drive off he realized he had broken something in the trucks driveline and blamed carl jokingly for telling him to not come back till it was done.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="story-item left-bubble">
      <h3>A Legacy of Breakage</h3>
      <p>I joked about him repeatedly doing that through his career with us. He then started to list off all the things he broke. A very long list of things in fact.</p>
